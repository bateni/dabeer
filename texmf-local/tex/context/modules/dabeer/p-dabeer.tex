%% TODO: These should receive font names via options.
%D Basic font definitions:
%D Previously, in order to avoid typescripts, we needed to use the
%D module \type{simplefonts} and macros like \type{\setmainfont}
%D defined therein.
%D For some reason, the following does not work properly if we simply
%D provide the font's name: In case of my Farsi fonts, the default
%D style will then be italic.
%D The additional benefit, however, is that we can map the italic style
%D to oblique, which better suits Persian text.  However, neither italic
%D nor oblique look good in Persian text.

%D We do not like to see special characters such as ZWNJ.
\setcharacterstripping[1]

%D Persian fonts usually have incorrect heights.  We fix this issue here.
\setupinterlinespace[line=3.2ex]  % default is 2.8ex

%D While we're at it, we might as well increase the parskip to make it more pleasing.
%D A more systematic way to handle this might be to use \type{\definewhitespacemethod}.
%D \type{halfline} and a bunch of other methods are already defined.

%D The following will fix \type{\quote} and \type{quotation}
%D delimiters.  I have not seen the half-guillemots in any real text
%D but I put it here as reference.  This is easy to change.
%% TODO: The following does not work in English texts.  So perhaps I
%% should put this under language customizations.

%D In Persian documents, we prefer all the numbers to use Persian
%D digits unless there is a reason not to (for instance, it is part of
%D an English text).  \CONTEXT\ provides several number conversions,
%D we plan to add a few more.  However, all of these had better be
%D placed inside \type{\LTR} macros because the bidi algorithm is not
%D applied everywhere.

%D We like to have Persian decimals for page numbers.  The proper place
%D to define these is in a style file (say, for an article or a book)
%D where, for instance, different numbering (digits, alphabetic, etc.)
%D may be used in frontmatter, body, appendices, etc.  Nonetheless, we
%D provide a default that works for most documents.  Same goes with
%D other numbering elements.
%% TODO: Is it possible to define ``shortcuts'' like n,g,a?

%D Goals we aim to achieve for section heads:
%D \startitemize[packed]
%D   \item Use Persian digits;
%D   \item Place chapter number to the {\it right\/} of the section number;
%D   \item Typeset each number from left to right; and
%D   \item Separate chapter and section numbers by dash instead of dot.

% TODO: is this sufficient?
\setuphead[section][sectionseparatorset=dashsep]

%D Footnote definitions.  We have several requirements here.
%D \startitemize[packed]
%D \item Footnote text should be processed by bidi algorithm.
%D \item Footnote text should use surrounding text's direction to
%D determine its direction at the bottom of the page.
%D \item Footnote rule's location (left or right) is determined by
%D the direction of the first paragraph of footnote text on the page.
%D \item Footnote numbers are typeset using Persian decimals.

\startsetups[bidi:footnotes]
  \setupdirections[bidi=on]
