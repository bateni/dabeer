CONTEXT macros for Persian

*Warning*: Since many RTL/Persian issues are fixed and features are added in the beta, we recommend trying a recent beta and not rely on stable version in the standard TeX distributions.  See the instructions for getting a recent [Standalone copy](http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ConTeXt_Standalone).

*Installation*: Copy the contents of `texmf-local` directory to a directory of the same same within the context distribution and then run `context --generate` to update the file list cache.
