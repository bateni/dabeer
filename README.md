CONTEXT macros for Persian

*Warning*: Since many RTL/Persian issues are fixed and features are added in the beta, we recommend trying a recent beta and not rely on stable version in the standard TeX distributions.  See the instructions for getting a recent [Standalone copy](http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ConTeXt_Standalone).
